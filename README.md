## Summary

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of programming puzzles.

This year I am doing it in Go and Python.

## Running the code

To run the code of a specific day from the root directory run the following, replacing `xx` with the day number, `01` - `25`:

```sh
go run day_xx/go/main.go
python3 day_xx/python/main.py
```

Make sure you [have Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To run the code of all days run the script:

```sh
./run_all.sh
```

Make sure you have given permission to execute (`chmod +x run_all.sh`).
